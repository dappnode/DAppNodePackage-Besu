    description: >-
      You must choose a config method. Most users should choose
      "normal" mode, but more advanced users will be able to customize the
      installation of Besu and its environment variables.

  - title: Storage Format
    id: storage_format
    description: >-
      Besu can use one of two storage formats, Forest of Tries or Bonsai Tries. 


      You can read about the differences [here](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Data-Storage-Formats). 


      Standard is BONSAI.

  - title: Sync Mode
    id: sync_mode
    description: >-
      Besu can use one of three sync modes, FULL (slow, archive node), FAST (fast, full node) or X_SNAP (fastest, experimental and works with BONSAI). 


      You can read about the differences [here](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#sync-mode). 


      Standard is FULL.

    id: enable_engine_api
    description: >-
      You can enable or disable the Engine API (the interface that communicates with your Consensus Layer Client) here.  
        
      It is not recommend that you turn this off **after the merge** if you are an active staker because you will stop attesting and proposing if the interface is down.

  - title: Max HTTP RPC connections
    id: max_rpc_connections_http
    description: >-
      To prevent flooding of the node, there is a sensible max connections limit. You can alter this variable here.
