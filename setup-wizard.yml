      You must choose a config method. Most users should choose
      "normal" mode, but more advanced users will be able to customize the
      installation of Besu and its environment variables.
    target:
      type: environment
      name: CONFIG_MODE
      service: besu
    enum:
      - "normal"
      - "advanced"
  - title: Storage Format
    id: storage_format
    description: >-
      Besu can use one of two storage formats, Bonsai Tries or the soon to be deprecated Forest of Tries. 
      You can read about the differences [here](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Data-Storage-Formats). 
      It is strongly discouraged to choose Forest of Tries for a new node.  
      Default storage format is BONSAI.
    target:
      type: environment
      name: STORAGE_FORMAT
      service: besu
    enum:
      - BONSAI
      - FOREST
    default: BONSAI
    required: true

  - title: Sync Mode
    id: sync_mode
    description: >-
      Besu can use one of four sync modes
        - FULL (slowest, full archive node) 
        - FAST (legacy, fast sync soon will be impossible to sync as it's too slow for mainnet)
        - SNAP (Default, 2nd fastest mode)
        - CHECKPOINT (Latest, faster then SNAP by ~1hour cannnot relay full chain history to peers.)

      Note: SNAP sync and CHECKPOINT sync are the fastest modes, CHECKPOINT being faster by roughly 1 hour.  Both modes sync quickly but the primary difference is that CHECKPOINT begins syncing near the head from a preset checkpoint block in the genesis file, and then fills in the historical blocks and necessary state info, while SNAP begins at genesis and starts downloading all trie and leaves info then executes it locally to calculate the chain. Also CHECKPOINT cannot serve the full chain history to peers.
        
      You can read about the differences [here](https://besu.hyperledger.org/stable/public-networks/get-started/connect/sync-node). 

      Default sync mode is now SNAP.

    id: max_rpc_connections_http
    description: >-
      To prevent flooding of the node, there is a sensible max connections limit. You can alter this variable here.
