      You must choose a config method. Most users should choose
      "normal" mode, but more advanced users will be able to customize the
      installation of Besu and its environment variables.

  - title: Storage Format
    id: storage_format
    description: >-
      Besu can use one of two storage formats, Bonsai Tries or the soon to be deprecated Forest of Tries. 

      You can read about the differences [here](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Data-Storage-Formats). 


      Default storage format is BONSAI.

  - title: Sync Mode
    id: sync_mode
    description: >-
      Besu can use one of four sync modes
        - FULL (slowest, full archive node) 
        - FAST (legacy fast sync (not actually fast), full node)
        - SNAP (Default, fastest)
        - CHECKPOINT (Latest, faster then SNAP by ~1hour)

        There are 2 Other soon to be deprecated experimental modes X_SNAP and X_CHECKPOINT both of which have been supplanted by their stable versions, please change to the non experimental versions soon or you may require a resync later.
        

      You can read about the differences [here](https://besu.hyperledger.org/stable/public-networks/get-started/connect/sync-node). 

      Default sync mode is SNAP.
